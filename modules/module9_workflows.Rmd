# Style guide

Try to avoid using the names of standard R functions for your objects, but R will generally be fairly smart about things.

```{r}
c <- 7
c(3,5)
c
rm(c)
c
```

Try to use upperCamelCase or underscores when naming your objects (and don't mix and match). Leave periods for use in the context of S3 objects.

```{r}
precipExtremes <- rnorm(5)  # precip_extremes
timeInDays <- rnorm(5)   # time_in_days
summary.lm(lm(precipExtremes ~ timeInDays))
```

# Debugging

As a scripting language, R essentially has a debugger working automatically.
But there is an official debugger and other tools that greatly help in figuring
out problems.

Let's briefly see these in action. I'll demo with a set of nested functions in
which one has an error:

```{r}
fun1 <- function(x) {
     x <- x * 2
     fun2(x)
}
fun2 <- function(x) {
     fun3(x)
}
fun3 <- function(x) {
     apply(x, 1, mean)
}
```    

1) We can use ``debug()`` to step through a function line by line

2) After an error occurs, we can use ``traceback()`` to look at the *call stack*

3) More helpfully, if we set ``options(error = recover)`` before running code, we can go into the function in which the error occurred

4) We can insert ``browser()`` inside a function and R will stop there and allow us to proceed with debugging statements

5) You can temporarily insert code into a function (including built-in functions) with ``trace(fxnName, edit = TRUE)``

# Testing


# Timing your code

> premature optimization is the root of all evil
>
> --- Donald Knuth, 1974

There are a few tools in R for timing your code.

```{r cache=TRUE}
system.time(mean(rnorm(1e7)))

library(rbenchmark)
x <- rnorm(1e7)
benchmark(ifelse(x < 0, x, 0),
                   x[x < 0] <- 0, replications = 5,
                   columns = c('replications', 'elapsed'))
```
For more advanced assessment of bottlenecks in your code, consider *Rprof()*.


# Memory use

You should know how much memory (RAM) the computer you are using has and keep in mind how big your objects are and how much memory you code might use. All objects in R are stored in RAM unlike, e.g., SAS or a database.

If in total, the jobs on a machine approach the physical RAM, the machine will start to use the hard disk as 'virtual memory'. This is called paging or swapping, and once this happens you're often toast.

You can assess memory use with ``top`` or ``ps`` in Linux/Mac or the Task Manager in Windows.

```{r}
x <- rnorm(1e7)
object.size(x)
1e7*8/1e6
print(object.size(x), units = 'auto')
x <- rnorm(1e8)
gc()
rm()
gc()
```

# Scripting

* Keep your code in script (i.e., text) files.
* Keep your files modular and focused.
* Write functions to reuse code.
* Learn a powerful, general purpose text editor

If you use a good editor (such as RStudio's built-in editor, emacs with ESS, Aquamacs, it's easier to write and understand your code.

You can then run blocks of code within RStudio easily.

To run all the code in an entire file, do `source('myCodeFile.R')`.

To run code as a background job in a Linux/Mac context:
`R CMD BATCH --no-save myCodeFile.R myOutput.Rout &`

Then you don't need to leave RStudio or R or a terminal window open. Your job will run by itself. If you are logged into a remote machine, you can log out and come back later.

IMPORTANT: make sure to write any needed output to a file (e.g. .Rda files, CSV files, text output from print() or cat()).

# The UNIX command line

Being able to operate your computer from a command line rather than via point-and-click in a GUI environment provides incredible power and flexibility to the user, as well as allowing for reproducibility and automation in your work.

In Linux and Mac, you just need to open a Terminal window. On the Mac this is in Applications->Utilities->Terminal. Once in the Terminal, you can treat your Mac as if it is a UNIX machine (which it is).

Windows has the old MS-DOS command line that allows some command line functionality. There is something call *cygwin* that provides UNIX-like functionality.

# The UNIX Philosophy

> Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
>
> Write programs to work together.
>
> Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

# Version control

The basic idea is that instead of manually trying to keep track of what changes you've made to code, data, documents, you use software to help you manage the process. This has several benefits:

* easily allowing you to go back to earlier versions
* allowing you to have multiple version you can switch between
* allowing you to share work easily without worrying about conflicts
* providing built-in backup

At a basic level, a simple principle is to have version numbers for all your work: code, datasets, manuscripts. Whenever you make a change to a dataset, increment the version number. For code and manuscripts, increment when you make substantial changes or have obvious breakpoints in your workflow. 

# Version control architectures

* Client-server (e.g., CVS, Subversion)
* Distributed (e.g., Mercurial, **Git**)

# Git data structure



# Git concepts: commit

a **snapshot** of work at a point in time

![Credit: ProGit book, by Scott Chacon, CC License.](figs/commit_anatomy.png)

# Git concepts: repository

a group of **linked** commits (DAG)

![Credit: ProGit book, by Scott Chacon, CC License.](figs/threecommits.png)

# Git concepts: hash

toy "implementation"

```{r}
library('digest')

# first commit
data1 <- 'This is the start of my paper2.'
meta1 <- 'date: 8/20/13'
hash1 <- digest(c(data1,meta1), algo="sha1")
cat('Hash:', hash1)

# second commit, linked to the first
data2 <- 'Some more text in my paper...'
meta2 <- 'date: 8/20/13'
# Note we add the parent hash here!
hash2 <- digest(c(data2,meta2,hash1), algo="sha1")
cat('Hash:', hash2)
```

# Stage 1: Local, single-user, linear workflow

Simply type `git` (or `git help`) to see a full list of all the 'core'
commands.  We'll now go through most of these via small practical exercises:


```{r, engine='bash'}
git help
```

# `git init`: create an empty repository


```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src
rm -rf jm-git-demo
git init jm-git-demo
```

Let's look at what git did:

```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
ls -la
```

```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
ls -l .git
```

# `git add`: adding content to the repository

Now let's edit our first file in the test directory with a text editor... I'm
doing it programatically here for automation purposes, but you'd normally be
editing by hand

```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
echo "My first bit of text" > file1.txt
```

Now we can tell git about this new file using the `add` command:

```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
git add file1.txt
```

We can now ask git about what happened with `status`:

```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
git status
```

# `git commit`: permanently record our changes in git's database

For now, we are *always* going to call `git commit` either with the `-a` option
*or* with specific filenames (`git commit file1 file2...`).  This delays the
discussion of an aspect of git called the *index* (often referred to also as the
'staging area') that we will cover later.  Most everyday work in regular
scientific practice doesn't require understanding the extra moving parts that
the index involves, so on a first round we'll bypass it.  Later on we will
discuss how to use it to achieve more fine-grained control of what and how git
records our actions.


```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
git commit -a -m"This is our first commit"
```

In the commit above, we  used the `-m` flag to specify a message at the command
line.  If we don't do that, git will open the editor we specified in our
configuration above and require that we enter a message.  By default, git
refuses to record changes that don't have a message to go along with them
(though you can obviously 'cheat' by using an empty or meaningless string: git
only tries to facilitate best practices, it's not your nanny).

# `git log`: what has been committed so far

```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
git log
```

# `git diff`: what have I changed?

Let's do a little bit more work... Again, in practice you'll be editing the
files by hand, here we do it via shell commands for the sake of automation (and
therefore the reproducibility of this tutorial!)

```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
echo "And now some more text..." >> file1.txt
```

And now we can ask git what is different:

```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
git diff
```

# The cycle of git virtue: work, commit, work, commit, ...

```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
git commit -a -m"I have made great progress on this critical matter."
```

* `git log` revisited

First, let's see what the log shows us now:

```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
git log
```

Sometimes it's handy to see a very summarized version of the log:

```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
git log --oneline --topo-order --graph
```

Git supports *aliases:* new names given to command combinations. Let's make this
handy shortlog an alias, so we only have to type `git slog` and see this compact
log:

```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
# We create our alias (this saves it in git's permanent configuration file):
git config --global alias.slog "log --oneline --topo-order --graph"
# And now we can use it
git slog
```

# `git mv` and `rm`: moving and removing files

While `git add` is used to add fils to the list git tracks, we must also tell it
if we want their  names to change or for it to stop tracking them.  In familiar
Unix fashion, the `mv` and `rm` git commands do precisely this:

```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
git mv file1.txt file-newname.txt
git status
```

Note that these changes must be committed too, to become permanent!  In git's
world, until something hasn't been committed, it isn't permanently recorded
anywhere.

```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
git commit -a -m"I like this new name better"
echo "Let's look at the log again:"
git slog
```

And `git rm` works in a similar fashion.

**Optional:** Exercise

Add a new file `file2.txt`, commit it, make some changes to it, commit them
again, and then remove it (and don't forget to commit this last step!).

# Local user, branching: the concept

What is a branch?  Simply a *label for the 'current' commit in a sequence of
ongoing commits*:

![](figs/masterbranch.png)

There can be multiple branches alive at any point in time; the working directory
is the state of a special pointer called HEAD.  In this example there are two
branches, *master* and *testing*, and *testing* is the currently active branch
since it's what HEAD points to:

![](figs/HEAD_testing.png)

Once new commits are made on a branch, HEAD and the branch label move with the
new commits:

![](figs/branchcommit.png)

This allows the history of both branches to diverge:

![](figs/mergescenario.png)

But based on this graph structure, git can compute the necessary information to
merge the divergent branches back and continue with a unified line of
development:

![](figs/mergeaftermath.png)

# Local user, branching: an example

Let's now illustrate all of this with a concrete example.  Let's get our
bearings first:

```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
git status
ls
```

We are now going to try two different routes of development: on the `master`
branch we will add one file and on the `experiment` branch, which we will
create, we will add a different one.  We will then merge the experimental branch
into `master`.

```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
git branch experiment
git checkout experiment
```


```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
echo "Some crazy idea" > experiment.txt
git add experiment.txt
git commit -a -m"Trying something new"
git slog
```

```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
git checkout master
git slog
```

```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
echo "All the while, more work goes on in master..." >> file-newname.txt
git commit -a -m"The mainline keeps moving"
git slog
```

```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
ls
```

```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
git merge experiment
git slog
```

# Using remotes as a single user

We are now going to introduce the concept of a *remote repository*: a pointer to
another copy of the repository that lives on a different location.  This can be
simply a different path on the filesystem or a server on the internet.

For this discussion, we'll be using remotes hosted on the
[GitHub.com](http://github.com) service, but you can equally use other services
like [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org) or [Gitorious](http://gitorious.org) as
well as host your own.

```{r , engine='bash'}
cd ~/src/jm-git-demo
ls
echo "Let's see if we have any remote repositories here:"
git remote -v
```

Since the above cell didn't produce any output after the `git remote -v` call,
it means we have no remote repositories configured.  We will now proceed to do
so.  Once logged into GitHub, go to the [new repository
page](https://github.com/new) and make a repository called `test`.  Do **not**
check the box that says `Initialize this repository with a README`, since we
already have an existing repository here.  That option is useful when you're
starting first at Github and don't have a repo made already on a local computer.

# Some ideas about reproducibility

* Never change a dataset manually. Always have a script that operates on the data. 
* Note when and where you download, and ideally download via a script as well (e.g., wget and curl are Linux tools for automated downloading.
* Produce figures (e.g., from R) via a script and not by point-and-click
* When making figures, use *save()* or *save.image()* to save all the inputs needed to recreate a figure, with the code for making the figure in a script file
* If feasible, include your code for doing analyses and making figures in the relevant document reporting the work by using Rmarkdown or Latex with knitr or Sweave. 
* Set the random number seed so someone else can duplicate your exact numbers

# Implementing Reproducible Computational Research

![In many of todayâs research fields, including biomedicine, computational tools are increasingly being used so that the results can be reproduced. Researchers are now encouraged to incorporate software, data, and code in their academic papers so that others can replicate their research results. Edited by three pioneers in this emerging area, this book is the first one to explore this groundbreaking topic. It presents various computational tools useful in research, including cloud computing, data repositories, virtual machines, Râs Sweave function, XML-based programming, and more. It also discusses legal issues and case studies.](figs/ircr-book.png)

The minimal amount of configuration for git to work without pestering you is to
tell it who you are:

``` bash
git config --global user.name "Jarrod Millman"
git config --global user.email "millman@berkeley.edu"
```

And how you will edit text files (it will often ask you to edit messages and
other information, and thus wants to know how you like to edit your files):

``` bash
# Put here your preferred editor. If this is not set, git will honor
# the $EDITOR environment variable
git config --global core.editor /usr/bin/jed  # a lightweight unix editor

# On Windows Notepad will do in a pinch, I recommend Notepad++ as a free alternative
# On the mac, you can set nano or emacs as a basic option

# And while we're at it, we also turn on the use of color, which is very useful
git config --global color.ui "auto"
```
